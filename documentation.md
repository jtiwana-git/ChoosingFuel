# Project 2: Shop Webfront

## PROJECT BRIEF

Creating a a front-end if a website for an e-commerce shop of my choice. The website need to have at least 4 pages that are easily to naviagate as well as be attractively styled and accurately coded. This webfront will be made using corre front-end web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- **<ins>HTML:</ins>** - The website must have at least four pages that are easily navigable using a consistent navigation bar. One of these pages needs to a product
  page which has space for a ‘visitors’ to leave a review, so that we can incorporate some JavaScript interactivity.

- **<ins>CSS:</ins>** - The page needs to have attractive, consistent, and user-friendly styling. You must have a consistent layout across the website, using CSS flex and/or CSS grid and/or Bootstrap components. You do not need to use
  Bootstrap, but whichever system you use, it needs to be responsive i.e. look
  good on different screen sizes.

- **<ins>JavaScript:</ins>** - Need to include the following JavaScript interactivity:
  - A dark mode toggle that switches between light/dark themes
  - Review functionality for example on a product page – where a ‘visitor’
    can leave a review which is immediately posted onto the same page.

## PROJECT PLAN

I was thinking of what ideas to come up with about what sort of website I wanted to create.

- <ins>Trip Advisor</ins> - I was thinking of creating a website that would allow users to review places they have been to. This would be a good idea as it would allow me to create a review system that would allow users to leave reviews and have them displayed on the website. However, I decided against this idea as I thought it would be too complex for me to create in the time frame I had.

- <ins>eShop</ins> - I then thought of creating an e-commerce website where users could buy products and leave reviews. This would allow me to create a review system and also create a product page where users could view products and add them to a cart. I decided to go with this idea as I thought it would be a good idea to create a website that would allow users to buy products and leave reviews.

- <ins>Blog</ins> - I also thought of creating a blog website where users could read articles and leave comments. This would allow me to create a comment system and also create a blog page where users could read articles. I decided against this idea as I thought it would be too simple and I wanted to create something more complex.

I didnt go for any of these ideas as I didnt feel these ideas would be satifying to create. I decide to create a project for type of engines for vehicles. People can view the engines and leave reviews on the engines. I thought this would be a good idea as it would allow me to create a review system for customers who are looking to changed their vehicles and not sure what engine to go for.

### CSS FRAMEWORK

I will be using Bootstrap for this project as it is a popular CSS framework that is easy to use and has a lot of components that I can use to create a responsive website. I will be using the Bootstrap grid system to create a responsive layout for the website. I will also be using the Bootstrap navbar component to create a navigation bar for the website.

## DOCUMENTATION

I have decided to upload the codes to github as I started the 10/01/2025 and some of the functionalities was working up until today (18/01/2025).

For this project I will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a front-end for a website. I will use HTML to create the structure of the website, CSS to style the website and JavaScript to add interactivity to the website. I will also use Bootstrap to create a responsive layout for the website.

When I first started the project, it wasn't structured files or the codes ie some of the CSS styles was in the HTML file and some in the CSS file. I decided to restructure the files and the codes so that it is easier to read and understand. I created a separate CSS file for the styles and a separate JavaScript file for the interactivity. I also created a separate HTML file for each page of the website.
